Design Issues :
1. Test classes doent had setUp or tearDown methods.
2. driver.get(), driver.quit() were written inside test methods, which should be part of @BeforeClass and @AfterClass
3. Instance variables were initialized inside test methods.
4. URL must be in @BeforeMethod .


Logical Errors :
1. Some IDs were wrongly used.
2. In SignInTest.java, Frame concept is use because SIGNIN button present in the frame.
    driver.switchTo().frame("modal_window");
 for returning back to main window, I have use - driver.switchTo().defaultContent()

3. In HotelBookingTest.java, Ideally we should give dates, which is missing in the code
